API specification
#################

A conforming implementation of the cosmology API standard must provide and
support the APIs and behavior detailed in this specification while adhering to
the following conventions.

- Functions may only be required for a subset of input data types. Libraries may choose to implement functions for additional data types, but that behavior is not required by the specification.
