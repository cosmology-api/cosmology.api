Support for ``float`` input
---------------------------

The default input type to cosmology methods is ``Array | float``. This means
that you can pass in a single float, or an array. This is useful for example
when you want to compute the angular diameter distance for a single redshift, or
for an array of redshifts. The ``float`` input is converted to an array of
length 1, and the result is returned as an array.

We document which array libraries support ``float`` inputs in the table below.
If you are using a library that does not support ``float`` inputs, you can use
the ``<array>.__array_namespace__().asarray`` function to convert your input to
an array.
