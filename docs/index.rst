The Cosmology API for Python
############################

The ``cosmology`` package aims to provide a standard interface to the many
different cosmology packages that exist for Python.  For example, it allows you
to start testing your code with e.g. an Astropy cosmology instance, and later
switch to e.g. a CAMB result instance if you happen to require the power spectra
or transfer functions.
